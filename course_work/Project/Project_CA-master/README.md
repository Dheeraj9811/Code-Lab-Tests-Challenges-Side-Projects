## Project Title
Memory Ordering Demonstration in Multicore Shared Environments and Implementation of Sequential consistency and Total Store Order

## Mid-Project Evaluation (MPE):
1. Demonstration of the reordering using memory litmus test:
   a) Store-store reordering.
   b) Load-load reordering
   c) Load-store and store load reordering.
2. Draw the execution of the litmus tests provide by you


## End-Project Evaluation (EPE):
Please ensure EPE completes the following:
1. Whatever you cannot implement in MPE has to be completed before EPE.
2. Implementation of na√Øve SC models to avoid reordering in the three litmus test.
3. Implementation of Total Store Order (TSO) memory mode
