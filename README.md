# 🛠️ Coding Chronicles: My Journey  

Welcome to **Coding Chronicles**, a curated collection of my coding experiments, practice challenges, and side projects from the past five years. This repository is more than just a storage of code; it's a snapshot of my learning process, showcasing:  

- 💻 **Online Assessments (OA)**: Problem-solving for technical interviews and competitions.  
- 🧩 **Practice Challenges**: Experimenting with algorithms, data structures, and new paradigms.  
- 🌟 **Side Projects**: Building mini-tools, automating tasks, or simply having fun with code.

## 🌟 **Why This Repo Exists**  
> **Note**: This is an unordered collection of my coding adventures—a time capsule of growth, creativity, and problem-solving. Think of it as a scrapbook for my coding journey. 🖤  

This is my playground—where I’ve:  
- Sharpened my coding skills.  
- Solved real-world problems.  
- Explored new frameworks, languages, and concepts.  
It’s a bit messy (like any learning process), but every file represents a step forward in my coding evolution.

## 🗂️ **What You’ll Find**  

- **Languages**: From Python and C++ to JavaScript and beyond.  
- **Topics**: Algorithms, machine learning, web development, robotics, and more.  
- **Inspirations**: Questions from coding platforms (LeetCode, HackerRank), personal projects, and experiments.

> **Disclaimer**: Some code here may be incomplete or experimental—it’s all part of the learning process. 😊  

Happy coding! 🚀
